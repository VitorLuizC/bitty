  - Its not based on newer browser's APIs or es2015+ features.

- üè∑ Safe:

### Installation from CDN

This module has a UMD bundle available through JSDelivr and Unpkg CDNs.

```html
<!-- For UNPKG use the code below. -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@bitty/pipe"></script>

<!-- For JSDelivr use the code below. -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@bitty/pipe"></script>

<script>
  // UMD module is exposed through the "pipe" global function.
  console.log(pipe);
  //=> "[Function: pipe]"
</script>
```

## Getting Started

Import `pipe` from package and just compose your functions with it.

```ts
import pipe from '@bitty/pipe';

const resolveToNumber = pipe(
  (value: unknown) => typeof value === 'number' ? value : parseFloat(value),
  (value: number) => Number.isNaN(value) ? 0 : value,
);

resolveToNumber('12389');
//=> 12389
```

The first pipe argument is an arity N function, so you can receive more than one argument in the composition.

```ts
import pipe from '@bitty/pipe';

const fromTextToWords = (text: string, wordsToIgnore: string[] = []) =>
  text
    .trim()
    .split(/\s+/)
    .filter((word) => !wordsToIgnore.includes(word));

const formatToInitials = pipe(
  fromTextToWords,
  (words) => words.map((word) => word.charAt(0)),
  (initials) => initials.join('').toUpperCase(),
);

formatToInitials('abra√£o  william de santana ', ['de']);
//=> "AWS"
```
